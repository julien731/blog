<p class="intro">This article is the first one of a series about how to setup a cloud server server running Ubuntu 12.04. This server will be used to run multiple sites. Essentially Ghost blogs and WordPress sites.</p>

<h2>Why DigitalOcean</h2>

<p>Beforehand, just a few words about why I chose DigitalOcean:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Their service seems high level,</li>
  <li>All plans include SSD,</li>
  <li>Very aggressive pricing,</li>
  <li>The interface is dead simple,</li>
  <li>You really are up and running in less than a minute</li>
</ul>

<h2>Create a Droplet</h2>

<p>The first thing to do is to create a Droplet. Their process is really well done and very clear.</p>

<p>As I want to be able to host multiple sites on this droplet, I didn't go with an Application image, but with a classic Ubuntu 12.04 x64 instead.</p>

<p>Their "55 seconds setup" is really not a lie. You really have your droplet up and running in less than a minute. It' pretty impressive.</p>

<h2>Setup SFTP</h2>

<p>I've heard so many times that FTP is a very insecure protocol that I didn't want to take any risk on this instance. I wanted to go with SFTP from the beginning and started to dig for tutorials on how to install ProFTPd with SFTP enabled.</p>

<p>After spending some time trying, I finally came across a very interesting post which basically said: no need for ProFTPd. As long as you can SSH into the server, you can SFTP as well.</p>

<p>I kept searching in that direction and here is what I came up with: create my users in Ubuntu, set their home directory, add them to a group, give the group the right permissions and that's it!</p>

<h3>Create a Web Directory</h3>

<p>First of all, let's create the directory. We will simply usr <code>/var/www</code> here. Try:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
cd /var/www
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If you get an error message saying the directory doesn't exist, create it by typing</p>

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir /var/www
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Our web directory is now ready.</p>

<h3>Add Users</h3>

<p>It's now time to add the desired users. For whatever reason I was not able to create a user and assign it a group at the same time. I had to do it in 2 steps.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
sudo adduser newuser
usermod -a -G www-data newuser
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now that the user was created, you can possibly give him root privileges if this user is an admin. See <em>"How to Grant a User Root Privileges"</em> in <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-add-and-delete-users-on-ubuntu-12-04-and-centos-6" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Last step for user creation is to change their home directory. The user's home directory is where he will land when reaching the server through SFTP.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
sudo usermod -d /var/www/ username
{% endhighlight %}

</ul>

<h3>Set the Permissons</h3>

<p>That's a pretty big part we have done so far. What you are now able to do is to connect to your server via SFTP, and land into the <code>www</code> directory. However, you will not be able to do anything here as you won't have permissions. We're going to fix this now.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
sudo chgrp -R www-data /var/www/*
sudo chmod -R g+rw /var/www
sudo chown -R username:username /var/www/*
find /var/www -type d -print0 | sudo xargs -0 chmod g+s
{% endhighlight %}

</ul>

<p>Here we are. You now have a cloud server that you can access via SFTP! Just open your FTP client and reach sftp://yourip on port 22 using the username and password you setup earlier.</p>
