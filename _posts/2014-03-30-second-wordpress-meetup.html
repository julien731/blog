<p>On the 24th was the second WordPress meetup I organized in Bangkok. We had the two founders of a successful WordPress company talk about the way they "productized" their WordPress development services.</p>

<p>Shinichi, a fellow WordPress developer helping with organizing the meetups, wrote an excellent summary of the meetup:Â <a href="http://th-daily.shinichi.me/2014/03/29/pronto-marketing-on-bangkok-wordpress-meet-up-march/" target="_blank">Pronto Marketing at Bangkok WordPress Meetup</a></p>
