<p>Yesterday was the day. First time I organize a meetup. It's been quite a rush in the end, but it was really worth it. I was very lucky to have <a href="http://siobhanmckeown.com/" target="_blank">Siobhan McKeown</a> speak about <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bangkok-WordPress/events/167479232/" target="_blank">getting involved in WordPress</a>.</p>

<p>As it was my first ever meetup (as an organizer), I was really curious to see how full (or not) would the room be. And it was a good surprise! About 15 people came to the event. Out of the 26 who RSVPed, it's about 61% attendance. Not bad I think.</p>

<p>The attendees were a good mix of Thais and foreigners. This is really important to me as I think it is the foundation of a good community. Both the Thais and foreigners were very interesting people and I'm hoping to see everyone again at future meetups.</p>

<p>If I had to summarize this meetup in one link, it would beÂ <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">http://make.wordpress.org/</a>. I'm going to spend more time there as soon as I have a chance.<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><br />
