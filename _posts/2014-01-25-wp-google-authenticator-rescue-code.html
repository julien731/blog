<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-google-authenticator/" target="_blank">WP Google Authenticator</a> has just been updated to version 1.0.4. This new version only brings <del>one change</del> few changes, but it's a pretty big one.</p>

<h2>Account Recovery</h2>

<p>There was one feature missing to the plugin until now: a way for users to log in their site even if they can't access the Google Authenticator app. If you just changed your phone for instance: you re-install the app, but you don't have all your profiles anymore. You're locked out of your site.</p>

<p>With the new recovery feature, when you activate <abbr title="2-factor authentication">2FA</abbr> for your account, a recovery code is automatically generated.</p>

<p>After you generated the recovery code, it will appear in your profile for 5 minutes. After that delay, you can always see your recovery code, but you will need to enter your WordPress account password before you can see it.</p>

<p>Now, if you have to use this code in a situation where you can't use the Authenticator app, you will be logged in just as usual, but  <abbr title="2-factor authentication">2FA</abbr> will be disabled for your account.</p>

<p>Next step is to go to your profile page and re-enable 2-factor authentication. You will setup the new account on your phone, and you're good to go.</p>

<h2>New Filters</h2>

<p>Version 1.0.4 introduces 3 filters that might be useful for advanced users of the plugin:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>wpga_secret_key_length</code>: allows you to change the secret key length. Default is set to 16.</li>
  <li><code>wpga_code_length</code>: alows you to change the length of the TOTP. Default is set to 6.</li>
  <li><code>wpga_recovery_code_length</code>: allows you to change the recovery code length. Default is set to 24.</li>
</ul>
