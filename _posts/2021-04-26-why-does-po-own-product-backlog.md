In Agile methodology, the Product Owner is the sole owner of a product backlog. There are good reasons for it. However, I have seen my fair share of backlogs being modified without the Product Owner being aware of it.

It is usually not malicious in any way. On the contrary, it often stems from the proactivity of team members who strive to improve the product.

However, doing so has consequences, and not everyone realizes what they are.

I have recently published a post on Nimble's blog about the reasons behind the backlog ownership and the consequences of making changes bypassing the Product Owner.
