Part of my job as a Product Manager at Nimble is to take care of the [development of several web and mobile applications](https://nimblehq.co/).

I am spending several hours per week looking at product management tools. That's a lot of time, and that's why I'm always trying to get the most efficient workflow possible, which means using the best possible tools.

Until recently, my go-to was Pivotal Tracker. However, and even though I still absolutely love this tool, I have been shifting towards Clubhouse.
I have done a full writeup about the reasons why on Nimble's blog: [from Pivotal Tracker to Clubhouse](https://nimblehq.co/blog/pivotal-tracker-to-clubhouse).
