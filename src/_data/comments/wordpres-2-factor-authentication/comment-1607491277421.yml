message: "The coronavirus pandemic has studied universities to swap to interval learning. essay writing service reviews <a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>online thesis</a> college essay help service. \r\nBut what is happening now can be named an special delivery of content to audience members in self-isolation . Many varsities  and the teachers themselves were not ready for the move to online. According to a 2019 HSE study, University teachers with an academic degree rate their level of proficiency in remote technologies at 3.2 points out of five. One in four people has never utilized remote video services to participate in webinars or video conferences in the past three years. \r\nBut educators are not required to own online learning technologies. They were simply not ready for this, although education and its advanced methods are the main function of varsities. Try to oblige the surgeon to do their work from home. Let him explain to the patient via Skype how to remove his appendicitis. It sounds absurd. Therefore, the resourcefulness with which professors adapt to the remote format is commendable. \r\n \r\nSome of the time it is funny. Colleagues from regional universities said that some professors asked to write conspectuses by hand and send them scans for verification.In present, people communicate remotely in real time thanks to modern digital technologies, students can \"raise their hands\" with only one button, they can write with a finger on a tablet as on a blackboard, and they are told: \"Please write a handwritten summary and send the scan.\" Or, for example, this case: a physical education professor asked students to shoot five-minute videos where they show physical exercises. In spite of the fact that remote physical excercises can be more original, for example, you can do selection of ready-made videos on YouTube, find checklists in the public domain, and teach them to play sports in self-isolation, while you can't go anywhere anywhere. \r\n \r\nUniversity professors are faced with a lack of guidance and difficulties in dealing with organizational matters. Someone conduct lessons on Skype, someone -in Zoom, someone only sends tasks to WhatsApp. Some professors record lectures on a webcam and send them to students. The quality of such materials is insufficient, and it is hard to perceive them. At least because the videos on YouTube, which students are used to, is shot and edited professionally and the viewer is spoiled by the quality of video materials. \r\nThere are also problems with monitoring attendance. Some educators ask you to put a \" + \" in the chat, others require  you to turn on Webcams and take screenshots of students. Against the background of all the misunderstandings and troubles, one element of academic life remains unchanged - assessment. Students don't study on campus, but they will get grades, even formal ones. \r\n<a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>write a thesis statement for your argument</a> \r\nOnline learning  does not have these disadvantages, because it is built on a carefully designed learning process in an electronic information and educational environment. Professors have instructions, manuals, memos,checklists, templates for emails and notifications, and even presentations. Everything is thought out here-from the screen saver before the lesson to the slide with homework."
