  i had been using cloudways for about 6 months and i must say their support was
  good but my site load time would never go below 2-3 seconds. Then i heard
  about easyengine and thought of tryng it and guess what the site loads now in
  mere 0.5 seconds. i will surely say easyengine is best for people looking for
  managing server for free and i have heard it can easily handle 10k real time
  user on 10$ droplet of Digital ocean but i m not sure about it.
