  Same here. I heard good things about them before I actually tried. I did not
  expect such a big improvement. I have always been happy with SP, but if you
  have the time to put a little extra effort in the server configuration (in my
  case it was the migration of a multisite with domain mapping and SSL that was
  annoying) then EE is definitely worth it.
