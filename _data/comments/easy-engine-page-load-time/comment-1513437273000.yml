message: "Are you able to compare EasyEngine with RunCloud? \r\nI'm not affiliated with any of these guys, been running a few sites off EE and SP setups, but a few days ago I discovered Runcloud. It offers much better GUI than bother ServerPilot and EE (none..) but it seems like a heavier install than both SP and EE. See, I can run 2-3 rarely visited WP installs on a server with 256Mb RAM on EE, but RunCloud crashes MariaDB on a server with 384Mb of RAM. \r\nHowever, it is amazing for any sort of install, really - Drupal, Joomla, WP and more. File manager is present just like a shared host and lots of other goodies. Free to try too and it is cheaper than ServerPilot, where you have to pay for each server. I'm very interested to hear your thoughts if you decide to try it. Again, not affiliated with those guys, just discovered the service. Thanks!"
