  Hi Julien. I'm still using MAMP, as the last time I looked at all the V's
  there were just three of them (no VVVV or Dashboard) so setting up new sites
  and monitoring/remembering them was a pain - I probably create three new
  Wordpress projects a week on average so the overhead of virtualising wasn't
  worth it. Reading this I may have to take another look so thanks for taking
  the time to write the article. One thing I'm worried about is the size of the
  virtual instances. At the moment I just have a single MAMP directory housing
  individual Wordpress installations for each project - what's the rough size of
  a new VVV image? And can they be easily backed up/restored by just moving
  them? Appreciate your time!
