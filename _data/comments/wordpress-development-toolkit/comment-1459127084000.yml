  Indeed VV + VVV Dashboard changes the game. Regarding the storage space, the
  development directory isn't that big at all. It really depends on how many WP
  sites you have and the size of themes/plugins.


  The virtual machine takes more space, but the beauty of using VV is that you
  run everything on one VM only. My VM is about 1.5Gb while my dev directory is
  about 50Mo at the moment.


  Regarding backups, the only thing you need is your dev directory as the VM can
  be re-created anytime. The one thing you wanna backup in case of computer
  reset or whatever is your DB:
