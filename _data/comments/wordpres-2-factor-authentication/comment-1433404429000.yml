message: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm living in France, but my wordpress server is in Canada.\r\nI've installed WP Google authenticator, but it doesn't work : the code is always wrong ?\r\nIs there a time-zone issue ??\r\n\r\nWhat surprise me is that I use the same process for my ssh access on the same server, and it's working well ?\r\n\r\nRegards !!"
