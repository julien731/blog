message: "Hello Julien,\r\n\r\nFirst of all, congratulations for the plugin.  Now, I have a problem.  I have had to reset my phone to default factory sets, and I have lost my Authenticator codes.  Now I decided to use Authy instead Google Authenticator, but the point is that I don't know how to regenerate the QR code to be read by Authy.\r\n\r\nCan you help me?\r\n\r\n:)"
