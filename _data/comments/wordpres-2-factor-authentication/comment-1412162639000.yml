message: "Hi Bob,\r\n\r\nNo worries, the plugin can work on sites anywhere in the world. The time I'm talking about it the \"base\" time. Every computer is set to a UTC time, and then it is altered depending on your timezone. What's important is the UTC time which should be about the same on every computer / server.\r\n\r\nRegarding the activation, you can only force <strong>all</strong> users to use the 2-steps authentication. You can't set it on a user basis."
