  I think the problem is that you have settings outside the brackets, which may
  be the source of your "Error trying to parse settings" error. Try placing all
  your settings inside the brackets like so:


  <pre>

  {
    “sublimelinter”: true,
    “sublimelinter_executable_map”:
    {
      “php”:”C:\\wamp\\php\\php.exe”
     },
    “warning_color”: “DDB700”,
    “wrap_find”: true
  }

  </pre>
