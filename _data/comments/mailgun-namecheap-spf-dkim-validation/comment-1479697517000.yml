message: "Hi Julien,\r\n\r\nI can't seem to make my DKIM verification go through.\r\n\r\nI hope you can help me out here...\r\n\r\nFor host name, I've input: k1._domainkey\r\n\r\nRegarding the value, I don't know if just copying and pasting should be the answer because I've noticed the capitalization of some letters change (on namecheap) when I paste the value.\r\n\r\nHope to here from you soon,\r\n\r\nThank you!"
