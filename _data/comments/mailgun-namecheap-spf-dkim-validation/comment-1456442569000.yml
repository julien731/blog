And your website helped, there are no errors, and it's very annoying.\r\n\r\nIf you use a subdomain: mg.example.com or email.mg.example.com the following happens:\r\n\r\nI used \"mg\" as the host value of the SPF record. Not @ symbol.\r\n\r\nFor the other I used \"mailo._domainkey.mg\" I did have to add the DKIM as suggested here.\r\n\r\nHope that helps others with their setup!!"
