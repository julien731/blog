message: "Hi, Giorgos.\r\n\r\nThanks for your comment. It is a very good question indeed! One that I've been asked on several occasions by friends.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the company where I work now isn't really a big business. We are about 20 people, which would make it more of a medium size business. But that's not the question.\r\n\r\nI've been wondering if it was the right decision for a long time. It was definitely a difficult choice, but I do not regret it as of today.\r\n\r\nI took this decision because it would allow me to take time and think about my next steps without financial pressure. Not having to run a business is an enormous amount of worry and stress that's taken off your shoulders. It was also the opportunity to see things from a different perspective.\r\n\r\nI am now roughly 9 months in, and I have already learned a lot of new things. By focusing more on certain tasks, I am also able to see problems that I didn't see before. Being employed is certainly not all bad and there are still a lot of things that can be learned and explored.\r\n\r\nI am definitely planning on going back to self-employment in the future (I can't see myself still doing the same thing in 20 years indeed!) but the journey I have started recently is definitely a positive experience."
