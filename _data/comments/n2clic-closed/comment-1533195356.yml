          Thanks for your comment. It is a very good question indeed! One that I've been asked on several occasions by friends.

          First of all, the company where I work now isn't really a big business. We are about 20 people, which would make it more of a medium size business. But that's not the question.

          I've been wondering if it was the right decision for a long time. It was definitely a difficult choice, but I do not regret it as of today.

          I took this decision because it would allow me to take time and think about my next steps without financial pressure. Not having to run a business is an enormous amount of worry and stress that's taken off your shoulders. It was also the opportunity to see things from a different perspective.

          I am now roughly 9 months in, and I have already learned a lot of new things. By focusing more on certain tasks, I am also able to see problems that I didn't see before. Being employed is certainly not all bad and there are still a lot of things that can be learned and explored.

          I am definitely planning on going back to self-employment in the future (I can't see myself still doing the same thing in 20 years indeed!) but the journey I have started recently is definitely a positive experience."
