message: "Great Post Julien. I am a plugin developer too and felt the same way when I heard about Dan's situation.  I know he wasn't doing anything shady but also know how really really hard it is to get people to leave good reviews.  \r\n\r\nIt's not that I only want the good ones, I don't mind constructive criticism, it's that most people just don't spend the time leaving good ones so sometimes it takes a little prompting.  I just saw your review request library and will be adding that next week. Thanks for sharing it.\r\n\r\nOne question for you, is Dan's situation driving the sale of the awesome support plugin, contributing or not related? \r\n\r\nI am struggling a bit myself with a choice to diversify into other areas or doubling down with WordPress.  I love WordPress too but Dan's situation has really made me realize how dependent I am on the repo and how exposed I am.\r\n\r\nThanks Julien"
