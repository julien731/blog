message: "Dan's situation is completely unrelated to Awesome Support. I just related to the situation as a plugin developer (and for having \"met\" the review team about WP Review Me).\r\n\r\nThis has been an eye opener for me too on how dependent I am on the repo and how little control I have over data that's crucial to my business. That's a little stressful."
