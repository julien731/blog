message: "I understand that the reasoning behind the rules in .org (the they can do whatever we want), is that they want total control over all the aspects of the repo.. which isn't a bad thing since they want a clean and proper plugin directory. The same goes with Otto's issue in your Github repo.\r\n\r\nI think the major issue everyone really has is with the review wipe that happened to Dan's plugin.. all 2 years' worth. And how swift it was implemented.\r\n\r\nI look up to Otto, but one of the things he said in your Github repo bothers me:\r\n\r\n&gt; The truth of the matter is that WordPress.org, as a community site, isn't a place for you to do your marketing... but that's not how we see it and it's not how we want you to see it either.\r\n\r\nI think there needs to be a reality check here. Yes, a lot of people place their plugins in WordPress.org for free and it revolves around the community. But in reality, can ALL plugin authors continue to put their plugins in the directory, and support them for nothing? We all need to make a living, and some of the most used/popular plugins have some sort of monetization in them.\r\n\r\nI say accept that people make a living off WP plugins, and help us in the directory. Think about it this way, if you remove all the plugins that get some sort of revenue anywhere (freemium, lite-premiums, free plugins that market others, premium-support driven free plugins), then we would most likely end up with a lot of dead and old plugins in the repo."
